 abstract = {"Sequential Analysis" is taken to include all those investigational procedures in which the final pattern of observations is not determined before the start of the investigation, but depends, in some specified way, on the data collected in the course of the investigation. The development of sequential methods has been much stimulated by the sequential probability ratio test introduced by Abraham Wald, and discussion of procedures based on this test occupies the major part of this survey (Section 3). Sequential estimation is also discussed (Section 5). Other techniques described include the stochastic approximation method of Robbins and Monro (Section 7); the "up-and-down" method of Dixon and Mood for quantal response problems (Section 7); Stein's two-sample procedure (Section 6); and inverse sampling (Section 8). Although the main purpose of the survey is to give a fairly simple guide to the techniques available for practical application, there is also a brief discussion of the position of sequential analysis from the viewpoint of general statistical theory (Section 9).},
